# Smart-Steps-Harvesting-Energy-from-Footsteps-with-Piezoelectric
The smart shoe project combines wearable technology and energy harvesting. It involves developing a shoe that can convert kinetic energy from walking into electrical energy using piezoelectric sensors, providing a sustainable power source for wearables.


Problem Statement:
          The problem statement for the smart shoe project is to address the need for 
sustainable and renewable sources of energy to power wearable devices. Traditional 
power sources are not environmentally friendly and require frequent battery replacements 
or recharging. The proposed solution is to develop a smart shoe that can harvest energy 
from the wearer's footsteps using piezoelectric sensors, convert it into electrical energy, 
and store it in a battery for use in powering electronic devices.


Objectives: 

 The objectives of the smart shoe project using a piezoelectric sensor can be: 

1. Design a comfortable and fashionable shoe with piezoelectric sensors for energy harvesting. 

2. Optimize the placement and configuration of sensors to maximize energy harvesting efficiency. 

3. Develop an efficient circuit to convert harvested energy into electrical energy and store it in a 

battery. 

4. Integrate the smart shoe with wearable devices for a sustainable power source. 

5. Evaluate the performance of the smart shoe in terms of efficiency, battery storage, and usability. 

6. Explore the potential for scaling up the technology for wider applications. 

7. Promote the use of sustainable and renewable energy sources. 

8. Reduce the environmental impact of traditional power sources. 

9. Provide an alternative power source for people in remote or underdeveloped areas. 

10. Encourage further research and development in wearable technology and energy harvesting.
